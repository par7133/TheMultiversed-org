# The Multiversed

Hello and welcome to The Multiversed!<br>
	  
The Multiversed is a light, simple, software on premise to build and own your buddy network.<br>
	   
The Multiversed is released under BSD license, it is supplied AS-IS and we do not take any responsibility for its misusage.<br>
	   
First step, use the password box and salt fields to create all the hashes to insert in the config file. Remember to manually set there also the salt value.<br>

Rember that the buddy creation has some limitation:
- one group / department can have only eight buddies;
- one zone can have max two buddies.
	   
As you are going to run The Multiversed in the PHP process context, using a limited web server or phpfpm user, you must follow some simple directives for an optimal first setup:<br>

<ol>
<li>Check the write permissions of your "data" folder in your web app Private path; and set its path in the config file.</li>
<li>Set the default Locale.</li>
<li>Disable the Demo.</li>	
</ol> 

By default The Multiversed open up in Demo mode but the software is fully functional. Every user can now login with the password to checkin and "your planet" comes build from scratch.<br>

# TheMultiversed.org

Hello and welcome to TheMultiversed.org!<br>
	  
TheMultiversed.org is a light, simple, software on premise to build and own your buddy network.<br>
	   
TheMultiversed.org is released under BSD license, it is supplied AS-IS and we do not take any responsibility for its misusage.<br>
	   
First step, use the password box and salt fields to create all the hashes to insert in the config file. Remember to manually set there also the salt value.<br>

Rember that the buddy creation has some limitation:
- one group / department can have only eight buddies;
- one zone can have max two buddies.
	   
As you are going to run TheMultiversed.org in the PHP process context, using a limited web server or phpfpm user, you must follow some simple directives for an optimal first setup:<br>

<ol>
<li>Check the write permissions of your "data" folder in your web app Private path; and set its path in the config file.</li>
<li>Set the default Locale.</li>
<li>Disable the Demo.</li>	
</ol> 

By default TheMultiversed.org open up in Demo mode but the software is fully functional. Every user can now login with the password to checkin and "your planet" comes build from scratch.<br>
